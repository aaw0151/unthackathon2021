Modules:
http, fs, mysql, url, crypto, keys (in .gitignore; used for API keys, SHA256 keys, and mysql database information), express, body-parser, formidable, and multer.

Required database information:
This project uses the following table names in mysql: locations and users.

Usage:
Run server using Node.js. Use "node app.js" to run.

Information:
This project was designed using Adobe XD. The front-end is created using HTML/CSS and JavaScript. The back-end is using Node.js and mysql for the database. The passwords are hashed using SHA 256 bit and are stored in the mysql database. The application uses The Maps Embed API by Gooogle to create the map and update the map.

About us:
Every year, food banks across the country work overtime to provide meals to families every day.
Food banks on average give 3.6 billion meals out every year and with the recent COVID-19 pandemic,
that number nearly doubled for 2020 alone. Our goal is to give everyone ease of access to food banks in their nearby area.
We also provide the ability for food banks to ask for certain supplies to keep them running smoothly.
Overall, our goal is to give those who need access to food a way to find help easily and without hassle,
because no one deserves to go hungry, especially during these trying times.
